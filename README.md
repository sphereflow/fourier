    Description
        This is a program and a library for experimenting with transformations
        and compression on image files much like jpeg
        The program takes in a file (called in.bmp), compresses it with a 
        specified transformation, uncompresses it
        and writes it out to out.bmp. Plus it displays the output image
        You can create your own transformations. With some more effort your own
        encodings.
